/** Ported from spacemolt-lib PR #53 (Carl's); to be replaced by the lib export once it ships.
 *
 * Order-book arithmetic — pure, no `Account`, no I/O.
 *
 * Everything else about a market is already on the server's own payload: a
 * `MarketListingItem` carries `best_buy`/`best_sell` (top of book),
 * `best_buy_qty`/`best_sell_qty` (units at that top level only) and
 * `buy_quantity`/`sell_quantity` (total units across every level). Read those
 * fields directly — there are no accessors here, because a wrapper around
 * `rows.find(...)` would only add a local convention for the server to drift
 * away from.
 *
 * What the server does *not* publish is what a given order actually fetches
 * once it eats through the top level. That's `walkBook`.

 * What `quantity` really fetches, consuming levels in order.
 *
 * Takes the server's own levels — a `MarketListingItem`'s `buy_orders` /
 * `sell_orders` go straight in, best-first, no reshaping.
 *
 * Multiplying quantity by the best price overstates any order big enough to eat
 * through the top level: the second unit may be worth less than the first. At
 * `frontier_station` fuel cells showed a `best_buy_qty` of 126 against a
 * `buy_quantity` of 993 spread over 12 levels, so sizing a trade off the top
 * level alone understates the market roughly eightfold — and valuing all 993
 * at the best price overstates the proceeds. Walk the levels instead.
